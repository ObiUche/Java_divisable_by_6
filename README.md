# Sum of Numbers Divisible by 6

Description

This Java program reads a sequence of integers from standard input and calculates the sum of all numbers that are divisible by 6.
How It Works

    The program first reads an integer n representing the total number of integers to process

    It then reads n integers one by one

    For each integer, it checks if it's divisible by 6 (using the modulo operator %)

    If divisible by 6, the number is added to a running total

    Finally, the program prints the sum of all numbers divisible by 6
